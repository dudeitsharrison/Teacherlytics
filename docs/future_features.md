# Future Features

This document outlines features planned for future implementation in the Staff Management System.

## Server-Side Storage
- **Description**: Replace localStorage with API calls to a backend server
- **Reason for deferral**: Core functionality needs to be established first
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Storage module already contains placeholders (`saveToServer`, `loadFromServer`)
  - Will require creating a backend API (Node.js, Express, MongoDB suggested)
  - Client-side code will need minimal changes due to the Storage abstraction

## Authentication
- **Description**: Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires server infrastructure
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Add login page and authentication state management
  - Integrate with school's existing authentication system if available
  - Implement session management and token-based authentication

## User Roles and Permissions
- **Description**: Role-based access control (admin, manager, staff)
- **Reason for deferral**: Depends on authentication system
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Define permission levels for different operations
  - Update UI to show/hide features based on user role
  - Implement server-side permission checks

## Data Import/Export
- **Description**: Import/export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- **Reason for deferral**: Core data models need to be stabilized first
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Add export buttons to relevant pages
  - Create import wizard with validation
  - Support batch operations

## Real-Time Collaboration
- **Description**: Allow multiple users to edit data simultaneously
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires server infrastructure and conflict resolution logic
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time updates
  - Add conflict resolution strategy
  - Show indicators for other users' activity

## Advanced Analytics
- **Description**: Enhanced reporting with advanced charts and insights
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires stable data and core features
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Integrate more advanced charting libraries
  - Add trend analysis and forecasting
  - Support custom report generation

## Mobile Optimization
- **Description**: Optimize UI for mobile devices
- **Reason for deferral**: Desktop experience is the priority for initial release
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Enhance responsive design
  - Consider developing a Progressive Web App (PWA)
  - Test on various mobile devices

## Offline Mode
- **Description**: Support offline usage with data syncing when online
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires complex synchronization logic
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Implement service workers for offline caching
  - Create sync queue for pending changes
  - Add conflict resolution for offline edits

## Data Backup
- **Description**: Automated and manual backup functionality
- **Reason for deferral**: Requires server-side implementation
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Scheduled automatic backups
  - User-triggered manual backups
  - Backup restoration process

## Performance Optimization
- **Description**: Performance improvements for large datasets
- **Reason for deferral**: Need real usage data to identify bottlenecks
- **Implementation notes**:
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large tables
  - Add data pagination from server
  - Optimize rendering and data processing
